# Marketplace Support Chatbot

This project is a chatbot designed to provide support in a marketplace, including answering frequently asked questions (FAQs), providing order status, assisting with product inquiries, and more. The chatbot is built using Node.js for the backend and React for the frontend, with Tailwind CSS for styling. It also incorporates natural language processing (NLP) using the `natural` library.
